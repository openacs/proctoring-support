  <msg key="Exam_mode">Exam mode</msg>
  <msg key="Exam_mode_message">&lt;h4&gt;Examination statement: Important
information for taking online examinations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;1) Participation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without exception,
only students who are officially registered for the course and/or the
examination on LPIS will be allowed to take the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam will only
be graded if all 3 of the following conditions have been fulfilled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have
	uploaded a photo that fulfills the necessary criteria to confirm
	your identity, if such an identification requirement was previously
	announced for the examination in question by the person responsible
	for the examination.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have
	consented to automated online supervision, if previously announced
	for this examination&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have
	confirmed that you have read and understood this examination
	statement&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By confirming the
examination statement, you also confirm receipt of the examination.
If you have received the examination but not fulfilled the identity
requirement and/or not confirmed your consent to online supervision
(as applicable), the examination will be declared VOID and will count
as an examination attempt. If you do not confirm the examination
statement, you will not be given access to the exam. This means that
the examination will not be graded and the examination attempt will
not be counted. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2) Technical requirements&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is your
responsibility to ensure that you will not be disturbed during the
examination and that all technical requirements (as previously
announced) are fulfilled (see &#34;Online Exam&#34;
and/or &#34;Technical Checklist&#34; in your online exam environment). WU
cannot guarantee a problem-free completion of the examination for
every student working on their individual electronic device. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;3) Starting and terminating/interrupting the
examination&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By confirming that
you have read and understood this examination statement, you also
confirm receipt of the examination, and the attempt will be counted.
The exam will be graded and counted towards your total number of
permissible examination attempts. This applies even if you terminate
the exam prematurely or do not submit your completed exam. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are forced to
terminate the exam prematurely or interrupt the exam due to technical
difficulties (e.g. loss of your internet connection), please contact
the person responsible for the examination without delay. To do that,
please use the communication channel previously announced for that
purpose by the person responsible for the examination. When reporting
the termination/interruption of your exam, be sure to include the
following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your student ID
	number&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exact time of
	termination/interruption&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot of
	the error message, if applicable 
	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are able to
solve the problem and continue with the exam, please report this with
the message &#34;Examination resumed.&#34; To be able to send such
reports in the event of technical problems, it is recommended that
you download the appropriate apps to your mobile devices before the
start of the examination. In this way, you will for example be able
to report the termination/interruption of the exam even if your Wi-Fi
connection fails. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where you
report the termination/interruption of the exam due to technical
problems beyond your control, as a general rule, the examination is
not graded and the examination attempt not counted. If you would like
to have your exam graded nonetheless, please contact the person
responsible for the examination immediately after the exam and
request that your exam be graded. The examination can only be graded
if all the applicable requirements for grading are fulfilled. Only
those parts of the exam will be graded that were completed without
any technical problems (i.e. under active online exam supervision).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;4) Cheating and identity confirmation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any attempt to cheat
on the exam (e.g. cell phone, consulting forbidden materials,
consulting other people) will result in the exam being declared VOID
and the examination attempt counted. You will also be blocked from
re-registering to repeat the examination for a period of 4 months
starting from the examination date. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having someone else
take your exam for you can constitute a criminal offense. Such
instances of cheating will be reported to the public prosecutor&#39;s
office, without exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If announced in
advance by the person responsible for the exam, automated online
examination supervision will be conducted for the duration of the
exam. This means that you and your screen will be monitored by camera
and microphone (video and audio) throughout the exam, and the
examiner will be able to see and hear the recordings. You need to
consent to this online supervision in advance under &#34;Online
Supervision&#34;. As soon as you start the exam, you will need to give
your browser permission to access your screen, webcam, and
microphone. Any attempts to manipulate the online exam supervision
will be considered attempts at cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;5) Permissible aids&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When taking this
examination, you may use only the aids explicitly listed by the
person responsible for the examination in the exam information under
&#34;Online exam.&#34; As a rule, no one else may be present in the same
room with you while you are working on the exam. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acknowledgment of
the information on receipt and completion of the examination 
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confirm that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I have read and
	understood the information given above on taking this written online
	examination
	&lt;li&gt;
	I fulfill all the requirements for taking this examination
	&lt;li&gt;I will complete
	the examination independently and without consulting any forbidden
	aids 
	&lt;li&gt;I accept
	receipt of this examination, i.e. I acknowledge that the exam will
	be graded and will count towards my total number of examination
	attempts
